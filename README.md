# Basic-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe implemented in Python using TkInter
Playing around with Python's TkInter and learning some object oriented programming to make this Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Credit to sentdex (https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) for his TkInter tutorial and teaching me how to switch between TkInter frames.
